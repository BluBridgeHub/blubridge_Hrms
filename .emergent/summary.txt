<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants a complete and strict UI/UX redesign of the entire HRMS application, covering both the Admin and Employee modules. The goal is to transform the application into a premium, enterprise-grade product with a look and feel comparable to industry leaders like Workday and SAP SuccessFactors.

**PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS (NON-NEGOTIABLE):**
-   **Visual Redesign ONLY:** Do not touch any business logic, functionality, workflows, calculations, or permissions.
-   **No Feature Removal:** All existing features must remain functional.
-   **Total Visual Overhaul:** The new design must have zero visual resemblance to the current HRMS.
-   **Creative Freedom:** Full creative freedom is allowed for layout, components, navigation, and interactions to achieve a premium feel.
-   **Specific Feature Request:** Add a working hours graph to the employee view.

The user has provided iterative feedback throughout the process, requesting specific color changes, logo updates, and component-level redesigns to align with their vision.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The agent has performed a comprehensive UI/UX redesign of the entire application, affecting all pages in both the Admin and Employee modules. This includes a new global style, a modern glassmorphism sidebar, new page layouts, and updated components.

Several specific user-requested modifications have also been completed, including:
-   Changing the primary color theme to a specific navy blue ().
-   Replacing the application logo on the login page and sidebars.
-   Adjusting chart line colors on both Admin and Employee dashboards for better visibility.
-   Redesigning the login page's left panel for a cleaner, minimalist look.
-   Styling the Add Stars form to match a user-provided design.
-   Improving the responsiveness of the main Employees table to prevent horizontal scrolling.

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working**: Adding filter functionality to the Weekly Attendance Overview chart on the main Admin Dashboard (). The goal is to allow the admin to filter the attendance data by team (All vs. a specific team) and by a selected date range (Today, This Week, Custom date, etc.). The agent has successfully added the UI for these filter dropdowns but has not yet implemented the backend logic to make them functional.
-   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done**: N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?**: Frontend testing agent
-   **User Testing Done**: N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
There are no pending bugs or issues. The current work is a feature enhancement.

**In progress Task List**:
-   **Task 1: Implement Filter Logic for Dashboard Attendance Chart (Priority: P0)**
    -   **Where to resume**: . The UI select/dropdown components for team and date range filters have been added. The next step is to implement the logic (likely in a  hook) that triggers when  or  state changes. This logic needs to process the chart data accordingly and update the  to re-render the chart.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?**: The admin will be able to dynamically filter the main attendance graph, making the dashboard more interactive and powerful.
    -   **Status**: IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?**: Frontend
    -   **Blocked on something**: No.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
There are no other explicitly defined upcoming tasks. The project is in a refinement phase, with the agent implementing user feedback on the newly redesigned UI.

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Complete HRMS UI/UX Redesign**:
    -   Redesigned all Admin module pages (, , , , , , , , etc.).
    -   Redesigned all Employee module pages (, , , ).
    -   Established a new global style and layout with a premium navy blue theme, glassmorphism sidebar, and modern components (, ).
-   **Specific User-Requested Changes**:
    -   **Color Palette Update**: Changed the application-wide primary color to .

    -   **Star Reward Form Redesign**: Updated the form in  to match a user-provided screenshot.
    -   **Responsive Employee Table**: Made the table in  more compact to prevent horizontal scrolling on zoom.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   **Issue recurrence in previous fork**: None
-   **Recurrence count**: 0
-   **Status**: NOT STARTED

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend**: React.js
-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (used via className props)
-   **Data Visualization**: Recharts library
-   **Architecture**: Standard Component-based Single Page Application (SPA).

**key DB schema**
The database schema was not explored as the task was strictly limited to UI/UX redesign.

**changes in tech stack**
None.

**All files of reference**
-   : Modified to add UI for new chart filters. The logic is incomplete.
-   : Table styling was adjusted for responsiveness.
-   : Form styling was updated to match a user-provided design.
-   : The left-hand panel was redesigned for a more minimalist, premium feel.
-   : The chart line color was updated.
-   : The core layout component, updated with the new logo and styles.
-   : Contains global styles, including theme colors and table adjustments.
-   : The new logo for light backgrounds.
-   : The new logo for dark/gradient backgrounds.

**Areas that need refactoring**
-   **Color Management**: Colors are hardcoded as string literals (e.g., ) throughout the components. Centralizing these theme colors in  or a CSS variables file would make future theme adjustments much more efficient and maintainable.

**key api endpoints**
API endpoints were not part of this UI-focused task.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Task is UI-Only**: Do not modify any business logic, API calls, or data processing unless it's to support a new UI-only feature (like the current filter task).
-   **Adhere to Design Direction**: The user has a strong vision for a premium and enterprise look. All new work must align with this aesthetic. The primary color is , but be aware of specific exceptions requested by the user (e.g., graph line colors, Star Reward page theme).
-   **Complete the Filter Logic**: Your immediate task is to finish the work in  by implementing the logic that connects the new filter dropdowns to the attendance chart's data.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **Request (IN PROGRESS)**: Add All/Team and date range filters to the attendance graph on the admin dashboard.

**Project Health Check:**
-   **Broken**: The filter functionality on the Admin Dashboard's attendance chart is incomplete. The UI controls are visible but are not wired up to any logic.
-   **Mocked**: Chart data across the application appears to be hardcoded within the components for display purposes.

**3rd Party Integrations**
-   **Recharts**: A charting library used for data visualizations like bar and line graphs.

**Testing status**
-   **Testing agent used after significant changes**: YES, an automated test run was performed after the initial bulk redesign and passed. However, numerous small changes have been made since.
-   **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop**: NO
-   **Test files created**: None
-   **Known regressions**: None known.

**Credentials to test flow:**
-   **Admin**:  / 
-   **Employee**: The agent's attempt to log in as an employee failed. Verification of employee-side changes has been done via code review, not live testing. This is a potential blind spot.

**What agent forgot to execute**
The agent has not completed the implementation of the filter logic for the Admin Dashboard's attendance chart. The UI elements were created, but they do not yet affect the data displayed in the chart.</analysis>
